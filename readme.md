## About Golek Pet Shop (GPS)

**Golek Pet Shop (GPS)** is a web application framework with a clear and focused purpose: to seamlessly connect pet owners with pet shop services in South Jakarta. We believe development should result in practical, user-friendly tools that solve real-world problems. GPS aims to simplify the process of finding and booking pet services by centralizing information and functionality into one intuitive platform. Key features include:

- **Advanced Search Engine**: A powerful search tool allowing customers to find pet shops by name or location and filter results by services, pet type, and price range.
- **Multi-Level User Architecture**: A robust, permission-based system with three distinct roles (Super Admin, Pet Shop Admin, Customer) to ensure organized and secure management of the platform.
- **Comprehensive Management Dashboards**: Dedicated dashboards for administrators to get a high-level overview of reservations, users, and platform activity.
- **Full CRUD Functionality**: Complete data management capabilities for Super Admins over pet shops, users, and pet profiles.
- **Integrated Reservation & Approval System**: An end-to-end booking process where customers can make reservations and pet shop admins can approve or reject them, with automated email notifications for all parties.
- **Detailed Reporting**: The ability for admins to generate and filter reports on key platform metrics, providing valuable business insights.

GPS is accessible and powerful, providing the tools needed to manage a multi-faceted service directory and booking system. Its clean structure and logical workflow provide a solid foundation for building and expanding the application.
